Task 2
According to the results of the Olympiad, participants are awarded diplomas. Those who score the same points receive diplomas of the same degree. The winner of the Olympiad is a participant who has received a diploma no worse than the III degree.
Based on the results of the Olympiad, determine the number of winners. 
Input: natural number of winners (N < 10000) and then N natural numbers â€“ the results of the participants (generate from 1 to 100)
Output: one number is the number of winners.
Example:
Input     N=10 			1 3 4 3 5 6 7 7 6 1
Output 			5
Comment		The winners are the participants who scored 7, 6 or 5 points
